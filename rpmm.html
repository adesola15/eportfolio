                            <br />
                            <p>Corazon has taken a highly ethical approach in their development of their heart health
                                monitoring device and its security. This is particularly important in the healthcare
                                sector because patient safety and data security are vital. They adhere to regulatory
                                standards and have implemented cryptography which is line with professional ethics
                                because it keeps information secure (Atlam and Wills, 2022). They also have charitable
                                initiatives which shows their commitment to social welfare by improving access for
                                disadvantaged patients.</p>
                            <p>An important aspect of Corazonâ€™s operations is their open bug bounty program, which
                                encourages independent security evaluations. This is proactive approach towards finding
                                vulnerabilities, is professional and shows ethical responsibility. Their response to the
                                discovered wireless connectivity vulnerability was to collaborate with the researcher
                                and this demonstrates transparency and a commitment to continuous improvement, which
                                helps maintaining public trust (Von Solms & Van Niekerk, 2013).</p>
                            <p>However, the use of a hard-coded initialisation value is a problem. This design flaw
                                currently has negligible risk, could potentially be exploited, which means they need
                                risk assessments and s mitigation strategy (Adams & Makramalla, 2015). However, they do
                                recognise this issue and show a willingness to address it. This reflects a strong
                                ethical foundation, and which means that they will remain accountable for their choices
                                (Shahri et al., 2017).</p>
                            <p>The British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct emphasises the importance of public
                                interest, duty to the profession, and continuous professional development. Corazon align
                                well with these principles, especially in their commitment to societal well-being and
                                their adherence to legal standards. However, the BCS Code also places a strong emphasis
                                on the avoidance of harm, and Corazon needs to address the hard-coded value issue more
                                to mitigate any potential future risks (British Computer Society, n.d.).</p>

                            <h3><u>Literature Review and Research Proposal Outlines</u></h3>
                            <h4>Guiding questions to support planning, revising, and refining of a literature review
                            </h4>
                            <h4>1. What is the focus and aim of your review? Who is your audience?</h4>
                            <p>The review will focus on the financial impact of ransomware and malware on the healthcare
                                sector. It will explore the economic challenges bought about by cyber threats and
                                discuss the need for strong cybersecurity measures in healthcare.</p>
                            <p>The audience will include healthcare administrators, policymakers, cybersecurity
                                professionals, researchers in healthcare informatics, and stakeholders in the healthcare
                                industry.</p>
                            <h4>2. Why is there a need for your review? Why is it significant? </h4>
                            <p>Cyber-attacks on healthcare systems are becoming more common and sophisticated,
                                resulting in significant financial impacts and operational disruptions. Understanding
                                the
                                financial impact is important for healthcare professionals to implement effective
                                cybersecurity.</p>
                            <p>The review is important because it will explore why there is an urgent need for enhanced
                                cybersecurity measures, it will help inform policy and decision-making, and contribute
                                to the
                                broader discussion on healthcare cybersecurity.</p>
                            <h4>3. What is the context of the topic or issue? What perspective do you take? What
                                framework do you use to synthesise the literature? </h4>
                            <p>We have to consider the increasing digitalisation of healthcare services and the
                                corresponding rise in cyber threats targeting this sector. The review will include
                                notable ransomware and malware attacks on healthcare providers.</p>
                            <p>The review will be looking from a financial perspective, analysing the economic impact of
                                cyber-attacks on healthcare providers.</p>
                            <p>I will categorise the literature into sections discussing the nature of
                                malware and ransomware, short-term and long-term financial impacts, case studies,
                                mitigation and prevention strategies, and emerging trends.</p>
                            <h4>4. How did you locate and select sources for inclusion in the review? </h4>
                            <p>I will locate my sources from academic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar,
                                as well as through industry reports, whitepapers, and official documents from regulatory
                                bodies. I will prioritise recent sources from the last few years.</p>
                            <h4>5. How is your review structured? </h4>
                            <p>It will have an introduction, then I will go into a background on ransomware in
                                healthcare.
                                I'll then have a section on the financial impact on healthcare providers, and case
                                studies
                                of financial impact in specifc attacks. Then there will be a section on mitigation and
                                prevention strategies and then a conclusion.</p>
                            <h4>6. What are the main findings in the literature on this topic? </h4>
                            <p>Ransomware and malware attacks cause significant financial losses due to ransom payments,
                                operational downtime, data recovery costs, legal fees, and increased insurance premiums.
                            </p>
                            <p>Long-term impacts include loss of patient trust, reputational damage, regulatory fines,
                                and higher insurance costs.</p>
                            <p>Effective mitigation strategies are regular software updates, employee training,
                                advanced security technologies, and comprehensive incident response plans.</p>
                            <h4>7. What are the main strengths and limitations of this literature? </h4>
                            <p>Strengths: There are detailed analyses of financial impacts, practical case
                                studies, and a range of mitigation strategies. It also explains why regulatory
                                compliance and government support is important.</p>
                            <p>Limitations: There are not any standardised metrics for measuring financial impact,
                                there are limited longitudinal studies on long-term effects, and potential bias in
                                industry reports. Also, the quick evolving nature of cyber threats means
                                that some information is quickly outdated.</p>
                            <h4>8. Are there any discrepancies in this literature? </h4>
                            <p>Different sources report varying estimates of financial losses due to differences in
                                methodologies and scope. There are also discrepancies in the reported effectiveness of
                                certain mitigation strategies and the role of cyber insurance in fully covering
                                financial losses.</p>
                            <h4>9. What conclusions do your draw from the review? What do you argue needs to be done as
                                an outcome of the review? </h4>
                            <p>The financial impact of ransomware and malware on the healthcare sector is significant,
                                and it needs big investments into cybersecurity. Short-term and long-term
                                financial impact mean there is a need for proactive strategies.</p>
                            <p>Healthcare providers should prioritise cybersecurity investments, including advanced
                                security technologies and employee training. Governments and regulatory bodies should
                                provide more support and resources. Further research is needed to develop standardised
                                metrics for financial impact and to explore the long-term effects of cyber-attacks.</p>

                            <h4>Note that you may find that you could be using a mixture of both the research methods
                                and the data collection methods. These considerations will be included in your
                                presentation of the Project Proposal in unit 10.</h4>
                            <p>Using a mixed methods approach for this literature review would be best because it gives
                                a well-rounded understanding of the financial impact of ransomware and malware on
                                healthcare. By looking at quantitative data like financial losses, ransom payments, and
                                recovery costs, we get clear numbers that show the economic damage these cyber-attacks
                                cause. This data helps us see how big and frequent these financial impacts are.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, qualitative insights from case studies, interviews with healthcare
                                professionals, and analysis of regulatory challenges provide deeper context. These
                                insights help us understand the disruptions to hospital operations, loss of patient
                                trust, and how healthcare organizations respond to these attacks. They show the human
                                and organisational sides of the financial impacts.</p>
                            <p>By combining both quantitative and qualitative data, we can get a complete picture. This
                                approach lets us find patterns and connections in the numbers while also understanding
                                the reasons behind them. This thorough analysis is important for suggesting effective
                                cybersecurity strategies, making policy recommendations, and guiding future research,
                                leading to stronger and more useful conclusions.</p>
                            <p>To use a mixed methods approach, I need to develop skills in both quantitative and
                                qualitative analysis. This includes using software like SPSS, Excel, and NVivo. I also
                                need to learn how to conduct and analyse interviews and surveys. Critical thinking,
                                effective communication, and data interpretation are important too. Being able to
                                combine different types of data and understand what they mean is essential for a
                                thorough analysis.</p>

                            <h4>In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA
                                (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook
                                users. They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen
                                this type of survey and probably participated at times). This is probably the highest
                                profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However,
                                this happens often through various media.</h4>
                            <h4>Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples
                                of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the
                                various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.</h4>

                            <p>The Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 showed how personal data from online surveys can
                                be misused. Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, got data from millions of
                                Facebook users through a personality quiz. When users took this quiz, they unknowingly
                                gave the app access to their data and their friends' data. This massive data collection
                                was done without proper consent and used to create detailed voter profiles to target
                                people with political ads in the UK and the USA (Confessore, 2018).</p>
