                            <h3><u>Collaborative Discussion 1: Digitalisation – What are the security implications of
                                    the digital economy? - Initial Post</u></h3>
                            <h4>Read Wei et al. (2019) and Spremic and Simunic (2018) and then post a message that
                                reflects your thoughts and responses to the questions below. You should support your
                                arguments with appropriate academic references.</h4>
                            <br />
                            <p>What is a 'fully digital enterprise'?</p>
                            <p>A fully digital enterprise refers to an organisation extensively using digital
                                technologies throughout its entire business operations, processes, and functions. This
                                involves integrating technologies such as AI, IoT, cloud computing, and blockchain to
                                boost efficiency, foster innovation, and enhance customer experiences. Wei et al. (2019)
                                explains that a fully digital enterprise in the power and utilities sector means
                                seamlessly adopting digital technologies for optimising energy generation, distribution,
                                and customer services.</p>
                            <p>What are the cyber security challenges/concerns with a fully digital enterprise?</p>
                            <p>In a fully digital enterprise, cyber security challenges come from an expanded attack
                                surface due to extensive digital integration. These challenges include sophisticated
                                cyber threats, data breaches, insider threats, and the mean there must be intelligent
                                and effective controls. Spremic and Simunic (2018) highlight the need to move beyond
                                basic security measures to tackle advanced and emerging cyber threats, focusing on the
                                importance of a comprehensive, organisation-wide approach to cyber security.</p>
                            <p>What are the cyber security challenges for a bricks and mortar SME aspiring to become a
                                digital enterprise?</p>
                            <p>Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) moving from traditional brick-and-mortar
                                operations to digital enterprises encounter challenges such as a lack of expertise in
                                managing cyber risks, insufficient technical skills, and the need for comprehensive
                                education. Heikkilä et al. (2016) state that there is an ongoing cat-and-mouse game in
                                cybersecurity for SMEs as the shift to a digital model introduces new vulnerabilities,
                                which means there should be implementation of sophisticated controls. Spremic and
                                Simunic (2018) suggest that companies in this transition phase may underestimate cyber
                                threats or express overconfidence in their existing controls, indicating a potential gap
                                in awareness and preparedness.</p>
                            <p>Chidukwani et al. (2022) call for a more comprehensive and quantitative research approach
                                to address the key challenges faced by SMEs and provide balanced guidance for cyber
                                threat detection, response, and recovery. Also, even though IoT has given rise to
                                security concerns, Alotaibi (2019) says there is the potential that blockchain
                                technology could address these limitations by enhancing end-to-end traceability and
                                ensuring data privacy, so there is hope for SMEs that are in transition that they will
                                be more supported when facing their challenges.</p>
                            <p>Do you agree with the views expressed, especially in light of the 'energy crisis'
                                experienced worldwide in 2022?</p>
                            <p>Taking the worldwide energy crisis in 2022 into account, I think that a well-implemented
                                digital transformation can be part of the solution by enhancing energy efficiency and
                                reducing environmental impact, but there would have to be careful planning with
                                consideration of the different challenges faced by SMEs from different sectors. There
                                are also new potential problems to consider when switching to a fully digital enterprise
                                such as power shortages and the cost of backup infrastructure.</p>

                                <p>I came up with mitigations for all phases but I think some phases would be harder to
                                    mitigate than others.</p>

                                <li>What tools would you utilise in each phase? Give reasons for your answer.</li>
                                <br />
                                <p>In the reconnaissance phase, Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools like Shodan and
                                    Maltego would be used to gather publicly available information, helping in
                                    understanding potential attack vectors (Yamin et al., 2022). For weaponisation,
                                    penetration testing tools like Metasploit can be used, which allow
                                    organisations to identify and patch vulnerabilities in their systems (Garba, 2019).
                                    Email filtering are important during delivery to stop malicious emails and prevent
                                    successful phishing attempts. Vulnerability scanners like Nessus and OpenVAS can
                                    be used in the exploitation phase to identify and patch weaknesses in systems,
                                    stopping attackers from exploiting known vulnerabilities (Singh et al., 2019).
                                </p>
                                <p>To counter unauthorised installations in the installation phase, Privileged Access
                                    Management tools can be employed to secure and manage privileged accounts. Intrusion
                                    Detection Systems like Snort and Bro could be used in detecting and blocking command
                                    and control activities during the C2 phase. Security Information and Event
                                    Management
                                    (SIEM) tools like Splunk and ELK Stack can be used during the objectives phase to
                                    collect and analyse log data, helping in incident detection, response, and
                                    post-incident
                                    analysis. Regular updates and testing are key for maintaining good cybersecurity
                                    (Singh et al., 2019).

                            <ul>
                                <li>Did you have any issues or challenges with the scans?</li>
                                <p>I was new to using these tools so I watched tutorials online to guide me through
                                    using them. Overall it was quite simple.</p>
                                <li>How did you overcome them?</li>
                                <p>The website given to us by the university had instructions that didn't work on my
                                    system. I conducted independent research to get tutorials that worked for me.</p>
                                <li>How will they affect your final report?</li>
                                <p>I am now more familiar with command line so I think this will help me during my

                            <h4>You have been tasked by an organisation to evaluate their website (provided in Unit 1)
                                and produce an analysis document. It should consist of:
                                <ul>
                                    <br />
                                    <li>Details of possible security vulnerabilities.</li>
                                    <li>A list of standards appropriate to their business and any non-compliance against
                                        those standards.</li>
                                    <li>A summary of recommendations and potential mitigations that could be used to
                                        ameliorate any risks. These should be ordered by importance.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                Your main conclusions will be presented in an executive summary, due at the end of Unit
                                6.

                                For this this first assessment, you will need to produce an analysis document that
                                promotes the benefit of what you will be doing for the business and sets a baseline for
                                the subsequent scans to be evaluated against.

                                    - Initial Post</u></h3>
                            <h4>Read Berger (2021) and Ekelhart et al (2019) and then post your thoughts on the issues
                                of logging for security analysis versus the issues of log-related exploits. You should
                                support your arguments with appropriate academic references.</h4>
                            <br />
                            <p>Both papers discuss important issues in security log analysis, and they focus on
                                challenges associated with log-related exploits. Ekelhart et al. (2019) take a semantic
                                approach to security log analysis, and they point out the limitations in the current
                                automated methods that use regular expressions and statistical correlations. They
                                suggest lifting raw log data, modeling context, and integrating events based on causal
                                relations for a more comprehensive understanding of unstructured log messages. Meanwhile
                                Berger's (2021) article provides a practical example of the Log4Shell vulnerability in
                                the widely-used Java logging framework Log4j 2, which was discovered in December 2021.
                            </p>
                            <p>Both authors emphasise the need for automation and scalability in security log analysis.
                                Ekelhart et al. (2019) highlight the importance of automating processes to handle the
                                increasing complexity and volumes of log data. The Log4Shell case shows the challenge of
                                scalability in dealing with widespread vulnerabilities across various systems.
                                Contextual analysis is also a common theme, with Ekelhart et al. (2019) expressing that
                                is it important to link events from different sources, whilst Berger (2020) discusses
                                the impact of the vulnerability in the context of affected systems.</p>
                            <p>Berger's also talks about timely patching as a crucial response to vulnerabilities, with
                                companies needing efficient solutions for identifying and prioritising vulnerable
                                systems. Everson et al. (2022) say that situational awareness and continuous monitoring
                                of systems is vital to combat vulnerabilities and mitigate the effects of the next
                                critical open-source library vulnerability.</p>
                            <p>The interconnectedness and dependencies amongst different platforms and services needs to
                                be considered, and the Log4Shell case shows this (Berger, 2021). Advanced, automated,
                                and context-aware log analysis is needed to address the complexity and scale of modern
                                information systems. Schmidt et al., (2012) say that this will include prompt patching
                                and continuous monitoring because security challenges are constantly evolving.</p>

                            <h3>Case Study: Reviewing an Assessment Reporting Template</h3>
                            <h4>You are tasked with reviewing the assessment template from PurpleSec.</h4>
                            <h4>Answer the following questions:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Does this template meet the NCSC stated requirement of preparing a baseline to use
                                    as a reference point for pen tests? If not what changes/amendments would you make?
                                </li>
                                <p>This template meets the NCSC baseline preparation requirements for penetration tests.
                                    It offers a comprehensive view of vulnerability scan results and outlines the
                                    methodology. It could improve by specifying the audit date, adding a concise
                                    executive summary, categorising remediation actions, and suggesting a timeline f
                                    or implementation.
                                </p>

                                <li>What are the two best lessons/examples presented in the report?</li>
                                <p>The report is good in in detailing vulnerabilities, providing descriptions, impacts,
                                    and solutions. This depth aids IT understanding.</p>
                                <p>Also, it offers clear and specific remediation actions, presenting an effective
                                    roadmap for addressing identified any issues.
                                </p>

                                <li>What two things do you think are unnecessary or could be done more effectively?</li>
                                <p>While detailed information is important, some sections might provide more technical
                                    details and jargon than necessary for executive-level readers. Adjusting the level
                                    of detail in the executive summary and risk assessment could make the report
                                    more accessible to a wider audience.
                                </p>
                                <p>The report could benefit from visual aids, such as graphs or charts, not just tables,
                                    to help convey the overall risk assessment more effectively. Visuals can make
                                    complex information more digestible, especially for stakeholders who may not
                                    have a technical background.</p>

                                teams:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>It is our belief that the future of the internet is based on content centric
                                        networking (CCN and/or NDN or COAST).</li>
                                    <li>It is our belief that the future of the internet is based on peer-to-peer
                                        overlay-based networking (BitTorrent, TOR, Freenet, KAD).</li>

                                        architecture.</li>
                                    <li>It is our belief that the future of the internet is based on the adoption of
                                        IPv6 and the rollout of the associated security measures (DNSSEC, HTTP/3, IPsec,
                                        etc.)</li>

                            <h4>Each team will make their opening arguments in support of their position. Each member
                                should provide at least one argument for their position – arguments can be presented in
                                the form of a slide deck.</h4>
                            <h4>Each team should argue against the other positions and defend why their point of view is
                                correct. Each team member should pick at least one opposing point of view and refute it.
                            </h4>

                            <p>I am assigned to Team 3.</p>
                            <p>Arguments for: 3. It is our belief that the future of the internet is based on the
                                MobilityFirst architecture.</p>
                            <p>The MobilityFirst prioritises seamless mobility, providing users with uninterrupted
                                connectivity as they move between networks. This is vital in today's dynamic world where
                                users frequently switch between devices and locations. MobilityFirst enhances
                                scalability, offering a reliable solution for the increasing number of connected
                                devices. Furthermore, its focus on naming data rather than locations aligns well with
                                the
                                evolving needs of a decentralised and globally distributed internet (Raychaudhuri et
                                al.,
                                2012).</p>

                            <p>Arguments agaisnt: 1. It is our belief that the future of the internet is based on
                                content centric networking (CCN and/or NDN or COAST).</p>
                            <p>Whilst content-centric networking introduces innovative approaches to content retrieval,
                                it falls short in prioritising seamless mobility, which is a critical aspect of the
                                modern internet. MobilityFirst's architecture, designed with mobility at its core,
                                provides a mobile solution in a time when users expect continuous connectivity
                                regardless nof their location (Amadeo et al., 2016).</p>

                            <p>Arguments agaisnt: 2. It is our belief that the future of the internet is based on
                                peer-to-peer overlay-based networking (BitTorrent, TOR, Freenet, KAD).</p>
                            <p> Peer-to-peer networks rely on distributed nodes, but they may face challenges in
                                providing consistent connectivity during mobility. MobilityFirst has dedicated a
                                focus on mobility, surpasses the limitations of peer-to-peer overlays, offering a more
                                comprehensive solution (Kumar et al., 2020).</p>

                            <p>Arguments agaisnt: 4. It is our belief that the future of the internet is based on the
                                adoption of IPv6 and the rollout of the associated security measures (DNSSEC, HTTP/3,
                                IPsec,etc.)</p>
                            <p>Whilst IPv6 adoption is necessary, relying solely on this transition will not address the
                                emerging challenges of mobility and global connectivity. MobilityFirst not only supports
                                IPv6 but goes beyond, ensuring a more holistic approach to internet architecture that
                                caters to changing needs (Jianping et al., 2016).</p>

                            <h3>Assignment Topic</h3>
                            <h4>Following your analysis document that you submitted in Unit 3, you should now produce an
                                executive summary that pulls together your findings, recommendations and conclusions in
                                a clear and unambiguous format. It should consist of:
                                <ul>
                                    <br />
                                    <li>A brief summary of the work carried out.</li>
                                    <li>Summary findings – presented in an easy to understand, non-technical manner
                                        (supported by graphics and charts as appropriate).</li>
                                    <li>A section that evaluates the website against two security standards – one of
                                        which must be the GDPR directive.</li>
                                    <li>Conclusions – with justifications.</li>
                                    <li>Recommendations – with justifications, ordered by business priority.</li>
                                </ul>
                                Note: the executive summary should organise any recommendations in order of the priority
                                to the business’ commercial needs. The organisation is particularly interested in how
                                well they meet current security standards (including the new GDPR directive) and expect
                                to see any mitigations required to meet such standards clearly called out as important
                                business requirements.

                            <h3>My Reflection</h3>

                            <p>This assignment has widened my understanding of effectively conveying
                                technical details to non-technical stakeholders whilst also allowing me to learn how
                                to conduct vulnerability scans on websites and interpret the results.</p>
                            <p>I found it beneficial that I had completed the audit assignment as it laid the groundwork
                                for this final assignment, and I found myself referencing back to it whilst I was
                                working. I had to use a lot of new tools and programs that I wasn't previously familiar
                                with and I found myself watching a lot of video tutorials, which I will do again in the
                                future if I am struggling with something.</p>
                            <p>As I finish my reflection, I recognise that the skills honed during this assignment
                                go beyond technical expertise. The ability to convey intricate cybersecurity details
                                succinctly and meaningfully is a valuable skill that I anticipate using in future
                                professional projects.</p>
