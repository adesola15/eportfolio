                            <p>What do the authors mean by the term ‘Industry 4.0’ - give two examples.</p>
                            <p>Industry 4.0 is the fourth industrial revolution, which involves integrating digital
                                technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, cloud computing, robotics, and
                                artificial intelligence into industrial processes. This revolution aims to create smart,
                                interconnected systems that optimise manufacturing and business operations, leading to
                                enhanced efficiency and more flexible production models (Ghobakhloo, 2020).</p>

                            <p>Give two real-world examples of risks that fit into the authors categories.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Data Privacy and Security Risk: In a smart manufacturing setup where IoT devices are
                                    used to gather data from various sensors on the factory floor, there's a risk of
                                    unauthorised access or cyberattacks compromising sensitive production data. A breach
                                    in data security could lead to loss of intellectual property and production
                                    disruptions.</li>
                                <li>Technical Risk: Adopting a new cloud computing infrastructure for business
                                    operations introduces technical risks. Issues such as system downtime, data
                                    migration challenges, or compatibility problems with existing software could happen
                                    during the transition. These technical risks could impact the integration and
                                    functionality of the new technology.
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                                in the cited study.</p>
                            <p>The case study by Markus Burger, Melanie Kessler, and Julia Arlinghaus, "Aiming for
                                Industry 4.0 Maturity? The risk of higher digitalization levels in buyer-supplier
                                relationships," supports the findings of Kovaitė and Stankevičienė on the risks of
                                digitalisation in Industry 4.0. Burger <em>et al.</em>,2021 explore the challenges of
                                increased digitalisation in buyer-supplier relationships (BSRs), emphasising the
                                resulting complexity of supply chains. They stress differences in digitalisation
                                maturity among companies, posing risks to BSRs because of varying technological
                                capabilities. The study focuses on understanding and managing risks within BSRs,
                                saying that the risks involve both technological factors and human decision-making.</p>
                            <p>Human decision-making is still important despite technological advances, and this
                                supports Kovaitė and Stankevičienė's points on practical implications and introducing
                                RADi as adecision-making support tool. The case study talks about the relationship
                                between digitalisation and supply chains, showing impact of Industry 4.0 technologies
                                such as IoT, big data, and automation. Both articles talk about the goal of guiding
                                enterprises in managing risks and maximising digitalisation opportunities.</p>

                                You should use the Threat Modelling Manifesto, the OWASP Threat Modelling Cookbook and
                                the ATT&CK libraries to inform your model design.

                            <p>Since Pampered Pets is located in Hashington-on-the-Water in the UK, it is
                                subject to GDPR if it processes the personal data of users that live in the
                                European Union (EU). The company collects customer data for transactions, and
                                potentially, for online orders if they decide to establish an online presence.
                                To comply with GDPR, Pampered Pets should ensure that customer consent is obtained
                                before collecting and processing personal data.</p>
                            <p>They need to implement a data protection policy for GDPR compliance, including obtaining
                                clear consent for data processing if they choose to make a website. They should also
                                encrypt sensitive information.</p>

                            <p>Since Pampered Pets handles face-to-face and potential online transactions, PCI DSS would
                                apply if the company processes credit card payments. The company currently uses a
                                computer for all sales and purchases, recording transactions digitally for VAT and Tax
                                submissions. Pampered Pets needs to follow PCI-DSS requirements for secure payment
                                processing. This includes using secure networks, encrypting cardholder data and
                                implementing access controls. Regular security assessments and compliance checks should
                                be completed.</p>

                            <p><b>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA):</b></p>
                            <p>HIPAA applies to healthcare providers, and since Pampered Pets deals with pet
                                foods it is not applicable. Also they are not based in the USA.</p>

                            <p><b>Assumptions:</b></p>
                            <p>I have assumed that the company does not explicitly handle sensitive health-related data
                                covered by HIPAA. Also I have assumed they do not operate in the USA or have USA based
                                customers.</p>
                            <p>I have also assumed the business will expand online, and online transactions might
                                involve the processing of personal data subject to GDPR.</p>

                            <h3><u>Assessment: A Report by a Security and Risk Management Consultant.</u></h3>
                            <h4>For this submission, you are tasked with carrying out a risk assessment, evaluating the
                                risks of both the effects of the digitalisation process and of the alternative of
                                maintaining the status quo to the business. Which would you recommend, taking both
                                assessments into account? Produce a risk identification report with your responses to
                                these questions.</h4>
                            <p>My Reflection:</p>
                            <p>Completing the risk assessment for Pampered Pets allowed me to apply the theoretical
                                concepts I had learnt to a real-world scenario in security and risk management. I
                                chose to use the STRIDE methodology for the current state and digitisation risk
                                assessment, changing the evaluation to the specific threats relevant to Pampered Pets'
                                business model. This meant identifying potential risks such as unauthorised network
                                access and tampering with warehouse data, adding to a more nuanced understanding of the
                                business' risks.</p>
                            <p>The assignment enhanced my analytical skills and provided practical insights into
                                using effective risk mitigation strategies. Making recommendations for Pampered
                                Pets, including implementing an e-commerce portal, secure payment systems, and improved
                                data security, showed me the importance of a strategic approach to manage business
                                operations especially when the business has a goal for growth.</p>
                            <p>Reflecting on this assignment, I am confident that the skills acquired, especially in
                                risk identification and mitigation, will be useful in the future. Completing the risk
                                assessment broadened my understanding of cybersecurity and highlighted the significance
                                of aligning security measures with business objectives to foster growth and resilience
                                against evolving threats.</p>

                            <h3><u>Optional Activity – GDPR Case Studies</u></h3>
                            <h4>Read the Data Protection Commission (2020) Case Studies (see this week’s reading list).
                                There are several case studies from 2014 – 2018 concerning GDPR related issues and
                                breaches. Chose a case study (should be unique to each student) and answer the following
                                questions:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses?</li>
                                    <li>How was it resolved?</li>
                                    <li>If this was your organisation what steps would you take as an Information
                                        Security Manager to mitigate the issue?</li>
                                </ul>
                            </h4>

                            <p>My case study is 2007 Case Study 8: Failure to respond fully to an access request
                                (Data Protection Commission, 2020).</p>

                            <p>This case study addresses the aspect of GDPR related to subject access requests
                                (SARs), in particular the obligation of a data controller to provide the requested
                                personal data within the given timeframe and to keep that data until the
                                end of the access request. It shows the importance of transparent
                                communication between the data controller and the data subject to make sure that
                                the scope of the request is understood and fulfilled.</p>

                            <p>In this case, the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) determined that the educational
                                organisation had broken Section 4 of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. The
                                resolution involved acknowledging that the complainant's access request covered a
                                broader scope than thought by the educational organisation. The DPC
                                said that the organisation should have preserved the CCTV footage for the
                                requested date and gotten clarification from the complainant before
                                deciding the scope of the request. As a result, the educational organisation failed
                                to provide all the personal data within the statutory 40-day period.</p>

                            <p>To tackle similar challenges, Information Security Managers should make sure
                                communication with individuals making access requests is as clear as possible.
                                Encouraging clear and detailed discussions, they should look for clarification
                                when necessary to understand the exact scope of each request. It's important to
                                establish robust procedures for preserving data when receiving access requests,
                                especially for information at risk of deletion based on the organisation's retention
                                policy. This approach makes sure of adherence to the obligation of supplying
                                requested information within the statutory timeframe (Rösch <em>et al.</em>,
                                2019).</p>

                            <p>Additionally, it's important to guarantee the organisation maintains thorough
                                documentation on how it handles access requests. Regularly providing training
                                to staff responsible for responding to these requests promotes a consistent and
                                compliant approach throughout the company (Hansen, 2022). Conducting reviews
                                and updates of data retention policies helps them stick to legal requirements.
                                Consideration should be given to extending retention periods for data relevant
                                to potential access requests or legal disputes, strengthening GDPR compliance
                                (Hansen, 2022).</p>

                            <p>Implementing automated systems or alerts that notify relevant personnel when receiving
                                access requests can enhance efficiency, ensuring a timely response and compliance with
                                regulatory obligations. Seeking legal guidance is essential to gain a clear
                                understanding of GDPR requirements, especially concerning data preservation and
                                communication with data subjects during access requests (Di Martino <em>et al.</em>,
                                2022). Finally, establishing a continuous improvement feedback loop allows for
                                learning from past access requests and investigations, refining processes and
                                reducing the risk of contraventions.</p>

                                information without misrepresenting what we know and do not know? Read the paper and
                                then and propose an answer, based on the research around future trends presented in this

                            <ul>
                                <li>Improved Visualisation Techniques: Enhance the representation of risk information
                                    through the development and application of advanced visualisation methods. Use
                                    graphical tools, interactive dashboards, and visual aids to effectively communicate
                                    complex risk data. This could involve the use of heatmaps, scenario analysis, and
                                    dynamic models to illustrate uncertain concepts in a clear and user-friendly manner
                                    (Aven, 2016 and Cox, 2012).
                                </li>

                                <li>Integration of Probability and Qualitative Approaches: Combine probabilistic methods
                                    with qualitative techniques to provide maangers with a more comprehensive
                                    understanding of uncertainties. Instead of just relying on probability
                                    distributions, also use qualitative descriptors that convey the strength and type
                                    of available knowledge. This approach makes sure there a balanced view of associated
                                    risks (Aven, 2016 and Borgonovo, 2007).</li>

                                <li>Transparent Assumptions and Justifications: Clearly outline and justify the
                                    assumptions that are made during risk assessments in a transparent way. Communicate
                                    the confidence level in these assumptions and acknowledge areas of uncertainty. This
                                    transparency makes sure that risk managers are aware of the limitations of the risk
                                    information and can consider these factors in their decisions (Aven, 2016 and Cox,
                                    2012).</li>

                                <li>Interactive Decision Support Systems: Develop user-friendly decision support systems
                                    that allows users to look into different scenarios, adjust input, and
                                    see how changes would impact risk outcomes. This would mean a flexible
                                    understanding of the risk, letting decision makers interact with the information and
                                    look into different perspectives (Aven, 2016 and Wu and Blackhurst, 2009).</li>

                                <li>Stakeholder Engagement: Involve stakeholders in the risk assessment process and
                                    change communication strategies to fit different audiences. Consider the
                                    backgrounds, interests, and expertise levels of different stakeholder groups to
                                    make sure that risk information is accessible and meaningful to a wide range of
                                    people making decisions (Aven, 2016).</li>

                                likely to be the shift towards dynamic risk assessment and management, particularly in
                                response to emerging risks and uncertainties (Flage and Aven, 2015).</p>
                            <p>Dynamic risk assessment and management involves a proactive and adaptive strategy
                                acknowledging the changing nature of risks over time. Compared to conventional static
                                methods, this approach involves ongoing monitoring, real-time adaptability, and flexible
                                response plans. It considers emerging risks, and addresses uncertainties and knowledge
                                gaps. Decision-makers are pivotal, actively participating in
                                continuous assessments and changing risk mitigation measures based on changing
                                conditions (Cheimonidis and Rantos, 2023).</p>
                            <p>The method focuses on the importance of ongoing feedback loops, allowing
                                organisations to navigate uncertainties effectively. Dynamic risk management is
                                especially pertinent in industries or projects susceptible to changing conditions,
                                offering a comprehensive framework for dealing with both known and unforeseen risks
                                promptly and flexibly (Aven, 2016).</p>
                            <p>Emerging Risk Concept: The concept of emerging risk, especially in relation to black swan
                                events, shows situations where background knowledge is weak. In these cases,
                                it suggest that a new type of event could occur in the future with potentially severe
                                consequences. Weak background knowledge makes it difficult to specify consequences and
                                scenarios accurately, which shows the need for different approaches beyond just pure
                                probabilistic methods (Flage and Aven, 2015).</p>
                            <p>Adaptive Risk Management Strategies: Dynamic risk assessment and management emphasises
                                the importance of balancing different risk management strategies in an adaptive manner.
                                This includes using cautionary strategies and an increased attention to signals and
                                warnings. Understanding the dynamic nature of risks, this approach calls for flexibility
                                in risk management strategies to effectively respond to evolving situations (Aven,
                                2016).</p>
                            <p>Development of Innovative Modeling and Analysis Methods: Lots of research and
                                development are needed to go beyond traditional modeling and analysis methods. This is
                                important for handling different types of systems, such as complex and
                                interdependent critical infrastructures and security-related applications.
                                The focus is on developing frameworks that integrate standard security approaches and
                                effectively address uncertainty in risk assessments.</p>
                            <p>Ethical Considerations in Intergenerational Decision-Making: Ethical considerations play
                                a significant role in decision-making situations. Questions are raised
                                about available frameworks, perspectives, and duty of care to future generations.
                                Adding ethical principles into risk assessments is going to be very important,
                                especially when dealing with long-term consequences and uncertainties (King <em>et
                                    al.</em>, 2018).</p>

                            <h3>Assignment Topic</h3>
                            <h4>Following assignment 1, Pampered Pets are not convinced by your report and have asked
                                you to create a python application that allows her to both visualise the attack
                                tree/ graph AND to add values to the nodes which the application will aggregate to
                                form an overall value impact to the business of any of the threats identified. This
                                serves as an unconventional executive summary for the company.</h4>
                            <p>My Reflection</p>
                            <p>Completing the Python application for visualising attack trees and assessing threat
                                impacts was a challenging experience, significantly addidng to my
                                understanding of cybersecurity and risk management. It was also the first time I used
                                Python to create visualisations and I found it very interesting to do.</p>
                            <p>This assignment has not only advanced my technical skills in Python programming but has 
                                also deepened my appreciation for the critical role of effective communication in conveying 
                                complex technical concepts to a broader audience. I had to do a lot of research because
                                the project required me to use NetworkX and Matplotlib, which are external libraries I 
                                didn't previously have a lot of experience in.</p>
