                            <h3>Review the article by Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021). Discuss one aspect of this article
                                which you find unexpected.</h3>
                            <p>One unexpected aspect of the article is the significant emphasis on collaboration during
                                the ePortfolio development process. The students' spoke about the benefits they
                                experienced from working with their peers. They expressed gratitude for the support,
                                comments, suggestions, and edits provided by their classmates.</p>
                            <p>To me this was unexpected because I think ePortfolios are seen as a showcase of an
                                individualâ€™s work. I personally saw them as a way for students to show their personal
                                growth and present their achievements. However, the findings in this article show that
                                collaboration also plays a role in students' ePortfolio development and working together
                                adds value to the educational experience. The collaborative aspect of ePortfolio
                                development can get students to engage more which improves learning outcomes and
                                encourages personal growth.</p>

                            <p> Michael Smith, an experienced taxi driver in New York City, made the transition from
                                manual cars to a driverless vehicle to alleviate the physical strain of driving all day.
                                With eight years of experience navigating the bustling city streets, Michael recognised
                                the toll it took on his body. Embracing autonomous technology, he now enjoys reduced
                                stress and fatigue, allowing him to focus on providing excellent customer service. As a
                                taxi driver, Michael appreciates the efficiency and reliability of his driverless car,
                                enabling him to transport passengers safely and comfortably while also improving his own
                                well-being. He looks forward to embracing the future of transportation while maintaining
                                his health and job satisfaction.</p>

                            <p> UML models are tools that help visualise and plan software systems at different stages
                                of development. The choice of which models to use depends on the specific project and
                                the needs of the developers and testers involved. However, the general use of UML models
                                during the Software Development Life Cycle could be:</p>

                            <h3>Discuss the metrics used to assess the features of an object oriented program.</h3>

                            <p> When assessing the features of an object-oriented program, several metrics are commonly
                                employed to evaluate its quality, complexity, maintainability, and other aspects. These
                                help people understand the codebase and make informed decisions for improvement.
                                (Shaheen <em>et al.</em>, 2019). The following metrics are commonly employed to assess
                                different aspects of the program: </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li> Size: Assessing the size such as population (number of classes and operations),
                                    volume (dynamic object count), length (e.g., depth of inheritance), and
                                    functionality (number of user functions), provide insights into the scale and scope
                                    of the program. Smaller classes are easier to comprehend and maintain
                                    (Henderson-Sellers, 1995).</li>

                                <li> Cyclomatic Complexity: This metric calculates the number of independent paths
                                    through the code, helping identify complex areas that may be error-prone and
                                    challenging to understand. Lower complexity indicates simpler code (Jamali, 2006 &
                                    Henderson-Sellers, 1995).</li>

                                <li> Coupling: This quantifies the interdependence and interactions between classes.
                                    Coupling metrics provide insights into the level of collaboration and communication
                                    between classes (Jamali, 2006 & Henderson-Sellers, 1995).</li>

                                <li>Cohesion: Cohesion metrics focus on how well a class's attributes and operations
                                    align to achieve a single, well-defined purpose within the problem domain. High
                                    cohesion implies that a class is focused, organized, and encapsulates related
                                    responsibilities effectively (Jamali, 2006).</li>

                                <li> Volatility: Volatility metrics assess the likelihood of changes occurring in the
                                    design or implementation of a class. Classes with high volatility require frequent
                                    modifications, highlighting areas that may require additional attention and
                                    maintenance (Jamali, 2006).</li>

                                <li> Sufficiency: It is used to assess the features of an object-oriented program and
                                    evaluates whether a class has the necessary properties to solve the problem it is
                                    required to solve. It aims to determine if the class adequately fulfils its intended
                                    purpose and requirements (Jamali, 2006).</li>

                                <li>Primitiveness: Primitiveness or simplicity metrics measure the extent to which class
                                    operations cannot be composed from other operations. A class with high primitiveness
                                    has simpler and more independent functionality (Jamali, 2006).</li>

                                <li> Completeness: Evaluates whether a class reflects all the properties and aspects of
                                    the problem domain, with the intention of enabling reuse (Jamali, 2006).</li>

                                <li> Similarity: Compares the structure, function, and behaviour of two or more classes.
                                    It helps identify similarities or differences between classes, helping with code
                                    organization, design decisions, and potential reuse (Jamali, 2006).</li>

                            </ul>

                            <p>By using these metrics, we can gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of
                                object-oriented programs, identify areas for improvement, and make informed
                                decisions to
                                enhance the quality and maintainability. </p>

                            <h3>Read Zhang & Budgen (2012). Which design patterns are used most commonly, and why?</h3>
                            <p>
                                The design patterns that are most commonly used in software design are Composite,
                                Observer, and Visitor. These patterns are popular because they are versatile
                                and therefore are used in many software development projects. They have a
                                significant impact on how software systems are structured and designed when
                                implemented.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One reason why The Gang of Four (GoF) patterns, which includes (Composite, Observer, and
                                Visitor) are the most commonly used is because they come with detailed guidelines and
                                examples. The GoF patterns are also widely used because they offer well-established and
                                proven solutions to common design problems that software developers can often encounter.
                                By using design patterns, they can improve code reusability, maintainability, and
                                scalability which means more flexible software systems.
