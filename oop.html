                            <h3>Review the article by Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021). Discuss one aspect of this article
                                which you find unexpected.</h3>
                            <p>One unexpected aspect of the article is the significant emphasis on collaboration during
                                the ePortfolio development process. The students' spoke about the benefits they
                                experienced from working with their peers. They expressed gratitude for the support,
                                comments, suggestions, and edits provided by their classmates.</p>
                            <p>To me this was unexpected because I think ePortfolios are seen as a showcase of an
                                individual’s work. I personally saw them as a way for students to show their personal
                                growth and present their achievements. However, the findings in this article show that
                                collaboration also plays a role in students' ePortfolio development and working together
                                adds value to the educational experience. The collaborative aspect of ePortfolio
                                development can get students to engage more which improves learning outcomes and
                                encourages personal growth.</p>

                            <p>The use of both unprotected (username) and protected (_password) variables show the
                                importance of data security and information hiding in real-world applications. I have
                                also learnt the significance of using a single leading underscore convention to show
                                protected variables, even though they are still accessible outside the class. This
                                exercise broadened my understanding of class design, data abstraction and access control
                                in object-oriented programming.</p>

                                Driver</p>
                            <p> Michael Smith, an experienced taxi driver in New York City, made the transition from
                                manual cars to a driverless vehicle to alleviate the physical strain of driving all day.
                                With eight years of experience navigating the bustling city streets, Michael recognised
                                the toll it took on his body. Embracing autonomous technology, he now enjoys reduced
                                stress and fatigue, allowing him to focus on providing excellent customer service. As a
                                taxi driver, Michael appreciates the efficiency and reliability of his driverless car,
                                enabling him to transport passengers safely and comfortably while also improving his own
                                well-being. He looks forward to embracing the future of transportation while maintaining
                                his health and job satisfaction.</p>

                            <p> Creating this model challenged me to think critically about what steps are taken during
                                real-world usage of a driverless taxi. I had to consider what systems would be used from
                                the start, during and the end of the journey. I had to put myself in the mind of a user
                                and this helped me understand why use cases are important when designing software.</p>

                            <p> UML models are tools that help visualise and plan software systems at different stages
                                of development. The choice of which models to use depends on the specific project and
                                the needs of the developers and testers involved. However, the general use of UML models
                                during the Software Development Life Cycle could be:</p>

                            <p> Creating a State Machine Diagram for a washing machine cycle was a good practical
                                application of my object-oriented programming knowledge which helped me appreciate the
                                importance of systematic modelling and design in software development. Breaking down the
                                washing machine cycle into distinct states took some research but helped me visualise
                                the entire process. Each state represented a specific stage of the washing process, and
                                transitions denoted the conditions triggering state changes.

                            <h3>My Analysis</h3>
                            <p> By implementing the Employee class, I practiced encapsulation and data organisation,
                                which helps in the management of employee-related data. The book_leave method lets users
                                to request leave whilst making sure that their leave balance is sufficient. The code
                                follows good coding practices by using clear and descriptive variable names and
                                providing meaningful feedback to employees when they are booking leave. As well as this,
                                the code uses user input validation by converting the input into an integer. Overall,
                                this exercise reinforces the importance of object-oriented principles and how they allow
                                for the creation of organised and user-friendly software systems.</p>

                            <p>The Car class and its subclasses SUV and Sedan demonstrate inheritance and polymorphism,
                                and they allowed me to reuse code and create specialised car types. The code
                                demonstrates how encapsulation works and ensures the appropriate management of
                                properties like speed for different car types. The code models different car types and
                                their functionalities and shows the power of object-oriented design in representing
                                real-world examples. It taught me the importance of designing classes with well-defined
                                methods and properties to create scalable and maintainable software systems.</p>

                            <h3>Discuss the metrics used to assess the features of an object oriented program.</h3>

                            <p> When assessing the features of an object-oriented program, several metrics are commonly
                                employed to evaluate its quality, complexity, maintainability, and other aspects. These
                                help people understand the codebase and make informed decisions for improvement.
                                (Shaheen <em>et al.</em>, 2019). The following metrics are commonly employed to assess
                                different aspects of the program: </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li> Size: Assessing the size such as population (number of classes and operations),
                                    volume (dynamic object count), length (e.g., depth of inheritance), and
                                    functionality (number of user functions), provide insights into the scale and scope
                                    of the program. Smaller classes are easier to comprehend and maintain
                                    (Henderson-Sellers, 1995).</li>

                                <li> Cyclomatic Complexity: This metric calculates the number of independent paths
                                    through the code, helping identify complex areas that may be error-prone and
                                    challenging to understand. Lower complexity indicates simpler code (Jamali, 2006 &
                                    Henderson-Sellers, 1995).</li>

                                <li> Coupling: This quantifies the interdependence and interactions between classes.
                                    Coupling metrics provide insights into the level of collaboration and communication
                                    between classes (Jamali, 2006 & Henderson-Sellers, 1995).</li>

                                <li>Cohesion: Cohesion metrics focus on how well a class's attributes and operations
                                    align to achieve a single, well-defined purpose within the problem domain. High
                                    cohesion implies that a class is focused, organized, and encapsulates related
                                    responsibilities effectively (Jamali, 2006).</li>

                                <li> Volatility: Volatility metrics assess the likelihood of changes occurring in the
                                    design or implementation of a class. Classes with high volatility require frequent
                                    modifications, highlighting areas that may require additional attention and
                                    maintenance (Jamali, 2006).</li>

                                <li> Sufficiency: It is used to assess the features of an object-oriented program and
                                    evaluates whether a class has the necessary properties to solve the problem it is
                                    required to solve. It aims to determine if the class adequately fulfils its intended
                                    purpose and requirements (Jamali, 2006).</li>

                                <li>Primitiveness: Primitiveness or simplicity metrics measure the extent to which class
                                    operations cannot be composed from other operations. A class with high primitiveness
                                    has simpler and more independent functionality (Jamali, 2006).</li>

                                <li> Completeness: Evaluates whether a class reflects all the properties and aspects of
                                    the problem domain, with the intention of enabling reuse (Jamali, 2006).</li>

                                <li> Similarity: Compares the structure, function, and behaviour of two or more classes.
                                    It helps identify similarities or differences between classes, helping with code
                                    organization, design decisions, and potential reuse (Jamali, 2006).</li>

                            </ul>

                            <p>By using these metrics, we can gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of
                                object-oriented programs, identify areas for improvement, and make informed
                                decisions to
                                enhance the quality and maintainability. </p>

                                subclasses to implement. The SavingsAccount class shows how inheritance allows for code
                                reuse, and allows for the creation of bank account functionalities whilst using the
                                abstract methods defined in the parent class. The code uses best practices by validating

                                encapsulated within the Car class and the code shows the principles of data hiding and
                                abstraction. The methods items(), keys(), and values() allow easy access to the car data
                                whilst maintaining encapsulation. The items() method returned key-value pairs, keys()
                                returned the car IDs, and values() returned the car details as values. This exercise
                                helped me develop my knowledge of class design and the importance of organising data in
                                a structured way. It also highlights the importance of using class methods to interact
                                with class data whilst protecting it from direct manipulation outside the class.</p>

                            <h3>Assignment Topic: A Design Proposal of Software to Support Operation of a Driverless Car
                            </h3>
                            <p>As a Software Engineer, you are given the role of designing the software which supports
                                the operation of a self-driving car. In your research around the capabilities of
                                self-driving cars, you can search for keywords that include autonomous vehicle,
                                driverless car, robotic car.<br /><br />You are required to identify three operations
                                that you
                                wish to support in your software and provision capability for them through the use of an
                                object-oriented Python program. The system should support the ability for a customer to
                                interact with the system through a front-end.<br /><br />Running in the system back-end
                                should be a capability that simulates the generation and
                                collection of data attributes that represent the wider environment within which the
                                driverless car is operating.
                            </p>
                            <h3>My Evaluation</h3>
                            <p>Going into this assignment I was confident I would be able to complete the UML models
                                because I have practiced making them in previous modules, however I was aprehensive
                                about creating UML models all for the same program, and actually designing the program,
                                as I was aware that I could possibly contradict myself if I was not intentional about
                                the information I put into each of my UML models. Therefore I was careful about the
                                order I made my UML models in, and whenever I made a change in one model, I made sure to
                                check back over each of my other UML models to make
                                sure they were all cohesive.</p>
                            <p>Nevertheless, the majority of work for this assignment when towards researching
                                driverless cars. When I first read the assignment I was a bit intimidated as designing a
                                program for a driverless car seems like a very technical task. However, once I
                                started researching and had chosen my operations I began to understand the direction the
                                final program would go in and so completing the UML diagrams became a lot easier.</p>
                            <p> I think this assignment taught me a lot in terms of perseverence, as when I started I
                                went in with the mindset of just trying to finish the asssigment because I was feeling
                                so overwhelmed, as I had never designed a program before, as I come from a healthcare
                                background. However by the end, once I had finished my research, I was proud of the work
                                I had done and this was reflected in my feedback which I was pleased to see was all
                                positive. I think I will take a new found confidence into all my assignments knowing
                                that even if I lack knowledge to complete a task, I can research and teach myself until
                                I get the answers.

                            <p>I used the unittest module to perform unit testing on the calculator's four basic
                                operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Each test case covered
                                different scenarios, including positive, negative, and zero values. The test cases give
                                feedback to make sure that the calculator functions produce the expected results. Using
                                assertEqual statements to compare actual and expected outcomes showed me the importance
                                of testing for correctness and handling differebt scenarios. This exercise taught me the
                                importance of thorough testing and validation in software development, and the
                                importance of testing edge cases and potential error scenarios. It also highlighted the

                                submitted, or in response to feedback received.
                            </p>
                            <h3>My Evaluation</h3>
                            <p>I started this assignment a lot more confidently than I did the system design assignment.
                                I think this was because 1. I had already completed the UML diagrams for the program so
                                I knew what I needed to do and 2. I had gotten good feedback so I knew if I followed the
                                plan I would produce a good program.</p>
                            <p>Even though we were told to write oour program in Codio, I personally chose to write and
                                test my program in Google Colab as I was introduced to it in our Launching into Computer
                                Science module and I find it simpler to use. I then just pasted my work into Codio and
                                saved it periodically.
                            </p>
                            <p>I found the easiest way to code the program was to implement the 'simplest' operation,
                                Autonomous Emergency Braking, then the most similar to it was Adaptive Cruise Control so
                                I added that to the program. Then finally I added Traffic Light Detection last. I
                                thought Traffic Light Detection would be the most difficult to code as I was thinking
                                about how traffic lights transition from green to amber to red to amber to green, and
                                wondered how I would code that, but I ultimately decided to just generate random colours
                                and deal with them seperately as it would still follow UML diagrams doing it this way.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I think with extra time it would be interesting to implement this, but I still hit the
                                requirements doing it the easier way. Something this assignment has taught me is
                                learning
                                to balance the time I have with the work I aim to produce. I will always try to produce
                                the best code I can but its important to be realistic as I do have a full time job, so I
                                think aiming to hit the learning objectives is a better goal.</p>
                            <p>
                                The most frustrating part of the project was actually the Adaptive Cruise Control as I
                                forgot to send the speed from the Obstacle Detector class to the Obstacle Avoidance
                                class
                                so the speeds being outputted were random. It took me a while to pick up on this but I
                                managed to debug it in the end which was a good experience as I know what to expect when
                                debugging code going forward.
                            </p>
                            <p> Overall I enjoyed this assignment and found it pleasantly challenging. I was also happy
                                with my final mark I recieved and felt it reflected the effort I put into the program.
                            </p>

                            <h2 id="content">Unit 12: Working with Design Patterns to Structure Code</h2>
                            <h3>Read Zhang & Budgen (2012). Which design patterns are used most commonly, and why?</h3>
                            <p>
                                The design patterns that are most commonly used in software design are Composite,
                                Observer, and Visitor. These patterns are popular because they are versatile
                                and therefore are used in many software development projects. They have a
                                significant impact on how software systems are structured and designed when
                                implemented.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One reason why The Gang of Four (GoF) patterns, which includes (Composite, Observer, and
                                Visitor) are the most commonly used is because they come with detailed guidelines and
                                examples. The GoF patterns are also widely used because they offer well-established and
                                proven solutions to common design problems that software developers can often encounter.
                                By using design patterns, they can improve code reusability, maintainability, and
                                scalability which means more flexible software systems.

                                professional/personal development.
                            </h3>
                            <p>When I first started this module, I found it more intensive than the last module which
                                was a surprise to me as I expected the workload to be similar to what I had been
                                previously doing. However, I have learned a lot and produced work I am proud of,
                                particularly my final assignment and my ePortfolio which I have refined a lot. My
                                academic background is not in computer science, so I was a bit worried about having to
                                design and implement a program from scratch, but in the end I am happy with the
                                assignments I was given as they forced me to learn at a pace that was quicker than I
                                thought I could. </p>
                            <p>Throughout this module, I have gained an understanding of the principles and practices of
                                object-oriented programming and have had the opportunity to apply this knowledge in
                                creating a driverless car program. Before this module, I only had a basic understanding
                                of object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes, objects and inheritance.
                                However, this module provided me with a more in-depth understanding of these principles
                                and their practical applications. I learned how to design classes and objects, how to
                                establish relationships between them using inheritance and composition, and how to
                                achieve data hiding and abstraction through encapsulation as well as how polymorphism
                                features in programs (Phillips, 2018). I was previously completely unfamiliar with UML
                                diagrams but now I understand how to create them, and I understand how they can be
                                useful to developers when writing software, especially more complex systems (Rumbaugh
                                <em>et al.</em>, 2004).
                            </p>
                            <p>Completing this module has strengthened my critical-thinking skills. Developing the
                                driverless car program required creative thinking and the ability to break down complex
                                problems into manageable components. By overcoming various challenges during the
                                development process, I have gained confidence in my abilities as a software developer.
                                The principles I learnt during the seminars and ePortfolio tasks have allowed me to
                                design maintainable applications. I am now confident in my ability to model systems
                                using classes, objects, and their relationships, leading to more efficient
                                problem-solving skills.
                            </p>
                            <p>Also, this module has improved my proficiency in Python, one of the most popular and
                                versatile programming languages which I have always been interested in learning. As I
                                simulated real-world scenarios in Python throughout the module, I became more
                                comfortable with its syntax, data structures, and object-oriented features (Reitz,
                                2016). This expertise in Python opens up numerous opportunities to learn more about
                                various topics, such as web development, data analysis, and machine learning.
                            </p>
                            <p>Just as important as the practical skills I have learnt is the personal development I
                                have made. There were times in this module where I was stressed due to the learning
                                curve I had to go through alongside working full time and managing my personal
                                commitments. However, I took the approach of ‘just getting on with it’ by carving out
                                time to do my work and not allowing anything to distract from it, and in that way the
                                work almost became therapeutic as it felt good to focus on one thing. I know I will use
                                this method of getting work done in other areas of my life instead of trying to juggle
                                and multi-task when it's not necessary. This mindset shift has taught me the resilience
                                needed to overcome obstacles and thrive in both academic and professional environments.
                            </p>
                            <p>I have also enjoyed completing my ePortfolio and learning more about why it is so
                                important for my development throughout this course (Di Silvestro and Nadir, 2021). I
                                have found it very satisfying to develop my own website and have a log of all the work I
                                have done throughout the module displayed, rather than sitting in a folder on my
                                computer and I found that knowing the mini projects I complete will be put into my
                                ePortfolio as artifacts motivating. One thing I would change would be my participation
                                with the forum discussions in Unit 1 and Unit 8 because I found myself focusing on
                                coding activities and reading papers. I think going forward I will attempt to engage
                                more with my peers as I think there is value in hearing a point of view that is
                                different to my own.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In conclusion, this module has been an enlightening and transformative experience for me
                                as a computer science student. I have learned valuable lessons that I will take with me
                                to my next module and beyond. Overall, I feel that Object Oriented Programming has been
                                an invaluable steppingstone in my journey as an MSc student, and I am excited to
                                continue building upon the skills and knowledge I have acquired.
