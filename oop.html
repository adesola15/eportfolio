                            <h3>Review the article by Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021). Discuss one aspect of this article
                                which you find unexpected.</h3>
                            <p>One unexpected aspect of the article is the significant emphasis on collaboration during
                                the ePortfolio development process. The students' spoke about the benefits they
                                experienced from working with their peers. They expressed gratitude for the support,
                                comments, suggestions, and edits provided by their classmates.</p>
                            <p>To me this was unexpected because I think ePortfolios are seen as a showcase of an
                                individualâ€™s work. I personally saw them as a way for students to show their personal
                                growth and present their achievements. However, the findings in this article show that
                                collaboration also plays a role in students' ePortfolio development and working together
                                adds value to the educational experience. The collaborative aspect of ePortfolio
                                development can get students to engage more which improves learning outcomes and
                                encourages personal growth.</p>

                            <p> Michael Smith, an experienced taxi driver in New York City, made the transition from
                                manual cars to a driverless vehicle to alleviate the physical strain of driving all day.
                                With eight years of experience navigating the bustling city streets, Michael recognised
                                the toll it took on his body. Embracing autonomous technology, he now enjoys reduced
                                stress and fatigue, allowing him to focus on providing excellent customer service. As a
                                taxi driver, Michael appreciates the efficiency and reliability of his driverless car,
                                enabling him to transport passengers safely and comfortably while also improving his own
                                well-being. He looks forward to embracing the future of transportation while maintaining
                                his health and job satisfaction.</p>

                            <p> UML models are tools that help visualise and plan software systems at different stages
                                of development. The choice of which models to use depends on the specific project and
                                the needs of the developers and testers involved. However, the general use of UML models
                                during the Software Development Life Cycle could be:</p>

                                    do from the users' perspective.</p>

                                    Diagrams: These diagrams show the flow of activities or steps in a process,
                                    helping us visualise how the system should work.</p>

                                    diagrams help developers understand how different parts of the
                                    system should interact with each other, which is important for coding.</p>

                                <li><b>Software development:</b></li>
                                <p>Class Diagrams: Developers use these diagrams to guide them when writing the code for

                                <p>Use Case Diagrams: These diagrams are useful for creating test cases to make sure the

                                    to design tests based on the expected interactions between different parts of the
