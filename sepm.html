                            <h3><u>Unit 1 Seminar</u></h3>
                            <h4>My Reflection</h4>
                            <p>I attended the Unit 1 seminar and it went over the team project that I will be completing
                                for the module. I enjoyed it as there were ice breakers which will jump start the
                                collaboration between my classmates I once I learn who will be in my team. Once I have
                                learnt who my team members are I will contact them by e-mail or MyCourse and give them
                                my phone number so I can set up a group chat.</p>
                            <p> The seminar also went over an introduction of what we will be learning in the module. It
                                went over on project failures and explained why it’s important that to plan meticulously
                                and implement risk mitigation strategies in real-world scenarios. It showed me why what
                                I will be learning in this module is important. We also went over the the roles and
                                responsibilities of different people in software engineering projects, which highlighted
                                the importance of effective communication and coordination between team members.</p>

                            <h4>Read the Behaviour Driven Development (2020) pages and then use the Gherkin language to
                                create a Gherkin sequence that addresses using a new coffee making machine. Your
                                response should consist of at least three scenarios describing different roles such as

                            <h3><u>e-Portfolio Activity: Data Structures Reflection</u></h3>
                            <h4>Read Dicheva & Hodge (2018). Think about an online system which you use on a daily
                                basis. Consider how it might operate at the back-end using data structures.</h4>
                            <p>In their 2018 paper, Dicheva & Hodge talk about the role data structures play in
                                the efficiency of online systems. They develop a Stack Game that is designed to
                                enhance learning in Data Structures courses. The game aims to help students understand
                                concepts around stacks and their application.</p>
                            <p>One online system that many people use everyday is Instagram. Instagram's backend
                                probably uses queues, lists, and graphs to manage user interactions and the content
                                users are shown. Notification queues handle the processing of notifications,
                                making sure of timely delivery without disrupting the user experience.</p>
                            <p>Lists link followers to the accounts they follow, helping in content
                                visibility and recommendations based on network connections and tagged content. Hashtag
                                lists enable content discovery and search functionality.</p>
                            <p>A social graph might represent user relationships, supporting features
                                like friend suggestions and personalised content recommendations. Together, these data
                                structures support good performance, scalability, and functionality across Instagram.

                            <h4>Read the articles by Verner et al (2014) and Anton & Nucu (2020) and then answer the
                                following questions:</h4>

                            <h4>What are the main risks that the authors identify? How do these fit into the traditional
                                SDLC model?</h4>
                            <p>Both papers identify various risks associated within their domains. Verner <em>et
                                    al.</em> (2014) focus on risks in global software development (GSD),
                                such as communication issues, cultural differences, project distribution, time zone
                                differences, and infrastructure constraints. These risks cover different phases of
                                the software development life cycle (SDLC), including project planning, execution, and
                                management. </p>
                            <p>Anton & Nucu (2020) go over the risks related to enterprise risk management
                                (ERM) like financial distress, low earnings performance, and board
                                independence. While ERM risks are more related to organisational governance and
                                strategy, they also overlap with the SDLC. For example, concerns about financial
                                distress might impact budgeting and resource allocation during the project planning
                                phase,while board independence can influence decision-making and risk management
                                strategies throughout the SDLC.</p>

                            <h4>Which of the frameworks discussed in the Unit 3 lecturecast would you use to capture and
                                categorise the risks?</h4>
                            <p>In the context of global software development (GSD) risks identified by Verner <em>et
                                    al.</em>(2014), Open FAIR could be used to quantify and prioritise risks associated
                                withcommunication issues, cultural differences, and infrastructure constraints. This
                                framework provides a way to analyse risk factors such as frequency, magnitude,
                                and impact, allowing organisations to assess the potential consequences of the GSD
                                challenges. Also, OCTAVE could be use to evaluate risks across different phases of the
                                SDLC, identifying vulnerabilities and threats in the project planning, execution, and
                                management stages.</p>
                            <p>For the enterprise risk management (ERM) risks outlined by Anton & Nucu (2020),
                                NIST frameworks like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) or Risk Management Framework
                                (RMF) could be used to address financial distress, low earnings performance, and
                                board independence concerns. These frameworks offer guidelines and best practices for
                                managing cybersecurity risks and matching risk management strategies with organisational
                                objectives. By following the these frameworks organisations can capture, categorise,
                                and mitigate the different risks associated with GSD and ERM within the traditional SDLC
                                framework.</p>
                            <h4>Add a risk and a suggested mitigation to the module wiki.</h4>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images\Risk Wiki.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <h4>Choose an entry made by one of your colleagues in the wiki and comment on how you might
                                mitigate it.</h4>
                            <p>One of my colleague's wiki entry discussed operational risk and focused on proactive risk
                                management strategies and the importance of mitigating internal threats. They suggested
                                employee training, regular risk assessments, technology utilisation, continuous
                                improvement and collaboration to align with industry best practices for operational
                                risk management. However, to further improve risk mitigation efforts, organisations
                                can also add strategies focused on scenario planning and response
                                readiness (Mitra, 2013).</p>
                            <p>By pre-creating potential risk scenarios and testing the effectiveness of response plans,
                                companies can be better prepared for unforeseen events and reduce negative impact on
                                operations. Also, creating a culture of accountability and transparency will
                                encourage risk identification and risk reporting at all levels of the organisation,
                                strengthening overall risk management strategies (AlHussaini and Karkoulian 2015).</p>

                            <h3><u>Collaborative Discussion 2: Factors Affecting User Experience</u></h3>
                            <h4>Human emotions can affect the user experience, a fact which contributes to the
                                complexity of user satisfaction with a product. Further complicating the process is the
                                fact that user emotions on the first use of a product are likely to be different to
                                their emotions once they become more experienced.</h4>
                            <h4> Read Minge & Thuring (2018). Based on the change in human emotion over time, might you
                                adapt Figure 1 in their paper in any way?</h4>
                            <p>To adapt Figure 1 from Minge & Thüring (2018) considering the changes in human emotions
                                over time, I would incorporate a temporal dimension to the figure. Adding a temporal
                                dimension to the figure could delineate different stages of user interaction: like
                                initial encounter, intermediate use, and long-term engagement. This would help to show
                                how user emotions transition from initial curiosity or apprehension to confidence and
                                satisfaction, or frustration, and then eventually to a stable state influenced by
                                ongoingupdates and changing user needs (Hermosa Perrino and Burmester, 2020).</p>
                            <p>I would aslo incorporate emotion indicators that would show how user feelings change
                                over time. For instance, color gradients or symbols could represent different emotional
                                responses at each stage. Initially, users might experience excitement or curiosity,
                                which could transition to frustration or satisfaction as they become more familiar with

                            <h4>My Reflection</h4>
                            <p>This piece of work spanned from Unit 1 to Unit 6, and my team completed work for it
                                alongside the other individual work we were completing for the units. I really enjoyed
                                working with my group and found them overall to be engaging, both with me and the
                                assignment. As discussed previously in Unit 1, I set up a group chat and added all the
                                team members and this proved very useful as it facilitated our collaboration on the
                                project.</p>

                            <p>The group chat is where we all arranged and agreed on our meeting times, and it was
                                during these meetings that we discussed the assignment and split up the work that had to
                                be done. We then agreed to complete the work individually and said that we would come
                                back together in meetings to discuss the work that we've done.</p>

                            <p>Below are the meeting notes for each meeting that we set up, there were only 4 as we did
                                keep in touch mostly over the group chat. We mostly contacted each other in between
                                meetings whenever any of us were working on the project and needed clarification or help
                                with something. There were also impromptu meetings for which we didn’t have notes.</p>

                            <p>The project also allowed me to apply what I had learnt from the module so far to a
                                practical scenario, I was able to practice writing Gherkin statements for a real project
                                (rather than just for making coffee!) and had to plan out a real project whilst
                                balancing cost, resources and time. Sometimes the assignment did confuse us and we had
                                to reach out to our tutor for clarification but I am confident we submitted a strong
                                piece of work and will recieve a good mark.</p>

                            <p>Overall, I enjoyed the project and it was a very good opportunity for me to collaborate
                                with my classmates and meet people on the course I hadn’t previously worked with. We all
                                had different experience levels with project management so it was fulfilling to be able
                                to teach people and also learn new thing from them, and made navigate the topic areas
                                that none of us had experience in a bit less daunting.</p>

                                (2019) (below), consider the ‘Emotional reactions’ of user experience.</h4>

                                response and write a minimum of 300 words as your response.</h4>
                            <p>Managing the emotional reactions of customers is very important to make sure there
                                is a positive user experience (UX). The 'Components of User Experience' (CUE)
                                model by Van der Linden <em>et al.</em> (2019) shows the importance of emotional
                                reactions to the overall user experience. Emotional reactions include feelings, motor
                                expressions, physiological reactions, cognitive judgements, and behavioral tendencies.
                                There are severale ways we can manage these.</p>
                            <p>1. Understanding and Addressing Emotional Needs</p>
                            <p>Understanding the emotional needs and triggers of your customers is very important.
                                According to Norman (2004), emotions play a significant role in human decision-making
                                and interaction with technology. Positive emotional responses can be bought about by
                                designing systems that are not only functional but also enjoyable and satisfying to use.
                                This involves adding elements such as aesthetic design, intuitive navigation, and
                                personalised content that engage with users on an emotional level.</p>
                            <p>2. Creating Positive Emotional Engagement</p>
                            <p>Creating positive emotional engagement can be achieved through thoughtful design and
                                interaction strategies. Hassenzahl (2008) talks about the importance of designing for
                                positive experiences by focusing on pleasurable aspects of use, such as joy, surprise,
                                and satisfaction. This can involve using visual and interactive elements that are
                                aesthetically pleasing, incorporating feedback mechanisms that provide reassurance and
                                satisfaction, and ensuring that the system responds promptly and accurately to user
                                inputs.</p>
                            <p>3. Monitoring and Iterating Based on User Feedback</p>
                            <p>Continuous monitoring and iteration based on user feedback aslo contribute to managing
                                emotional reactions. According to Kujala <em>et al.</em> (2011), user feedback should be
                                systematically collected and analysed to understand emotional responses and identify
                                areas for improvement. Surveys, usability testing, and emotional analytics can provide
                                valuable insights into how users feel when interacting with the system. This feedback
                                can then guide design improvements that improve the overall emotional experience.</p>
                            <p>4. Addressing Negative Emotions Proactively</p>
                            <p>Proactively addressing negative emotions is part of preventing dissatisfaction and
                                disengagement. Lazarus (1991) suggests that negative emotional reactions, such as
                                frustration, confusion, or anxiety, can significantly impact the user experience. As a
                                project manager, it is important to identify potential sources of negative emotions and
                                address them through user-centered design practices. This involves simplifying
                                complex processes, providing clear instructions and support, and ensuring that error
                                messages are helpful and non-threatening.</p>
                            <p>5. Building Trust and Reliability</p>
                            <p>Building trust and reliability is another key factor in managing emotional reactions.
                                Research by McKnight <em>et al.</em> (2002) indicates that trust in technology is a
                                significant part of user satisfaction and emotional engagement. Making sure that the
                                system is secure, and transparent can help build trust and create a positive emotional
                                connection with users. Providing consistent performance, safeguarding user data, and
                                being transparent about how the system works will all contribute to a trustworthy user
                                experience.</p>
                            <p>As a Project Manager, effectively managing the emotional reactions of customers means
                                understanding their emotional needs, creating positive engagement, continuously
                                updating based on feedback, addressing negative emotions proactively, and
                                building trust and reliability. By doing this you can enhance the overall user
                                experience and build positive emotional connections with your customers.</p>

                                repository.</h4>
                            <p>My existing code is a program that implements a regex that complies with the UK postocde
                                rules and tests it against some examples.</p>
                            <pre><code>
    import re 

    def validate_postcode(postcode): 

        # Define a regex pattern for postcodes 
        pattern = r'^[A-Z]{1,2}\d{1,2} \d[A-Z]{2}$' 

        # Use re.match to validate the postcode 
        if re.match(pattern, postcode): 
            return True 
        else: 
            return False 

    # Examples 
    postcodes = [ 
        "M1 1AA", 
        "M60 1NW", 
        "CR2 6XH", 
        "DN55 1PT", 
        "W1A 1HQ", 
        "EC1A 1BB", 
    ] 

    for postcode in postcodes: 
        if validate_postcode(postcode): 
            print(f"{postcode} is a valid UK postcode.") 
        else: 
            print(f"{postcode} is not a valid UK postcode.") 
                            </code></pre>

                            <p>To improve the code I will use the following strategies:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Follow PEP 8 guidelines for style and conventions. To do this I added a docstring to
                                    the validate_postcode function and main function and added type hints for the
                                    validate_postcode function.</li>
                                <li>Use meaningful variable names and proper code structure. The main execution function
                                    is called main and the main logic is wrapped in it. I have also used if __name__ ==
                                    "__main__": to allow the script to be imported without running the main code.</li>
                                <li>Simplify logic with Pythonic idioms. I have simplified the return statement in
                                    validate_postcode by directly returning the boolean result of re.match.
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <pre><code>

                            <h4>Reflection on Software Quality.</h4>
                            <h4>Review the article by McCall, Richards & Walters (1977). Select a timelier academic
                                article on software quality. Discuss, in 300 words, the major differences in relation to
                                software quality between the two articles.</h4>
                            <p>The two articles, "A Review of Software Quality Models for the Evaluation of Software
                                Products" by Miguel <em>et al.</em> in 2014, and "Factors in Software Quality, Concept
                                and Definitions of Software Quality" by McCall <em>et al.</em> in 1977, present
                                different perspectives on software quality, and comparing the two articles to each other
                                shows the evolution of the field over several decades.</p>
                            <p>McCall <em>et al.</em>‘s article, published in 1977, lays the foundations for
                                understanding software quality. It defines very important factors and concepts. It
                                introduces a simple but foundational framework for evaluating software quality,
                                categorising factors into characteristics like correctness, reliability, efficiency,
                                integrity, maintainability, and flexibility. However, the approach is simplified when
                                compared to modern standards. The assessment relies on binary evaluations (Yes/No) and
                                does not consider certain functionalities, like the user's perspective.</p>
                            <p>In contrast, Miguel <em>et al.</em>’s review provides a more modern overview of software
                                quality models, which reflects advancements in field and shows how it has become more
                                complex. Published 37 years later, this review explains various quality models that have
                                been developed in that time, offering more refined assessments. It discusses models like
                                the original McCall Model, but also the newer Boehm Model, Dromey Model, FURPS Model,
                                ISO 9126 Model, ISO 25010 Model, and other tailored quality models. These models take
                                into consideration a broader range of quality attributes and perspectives, including
                                functionality, usability, reliability, maintainability, and portability.</p>
                            <p>One major difference between the two articles is in their depth and scope. McCall <em>et
                                    al.</em>’s article presents a foundational understanding of software quality,
                                focusing on basic factors and definitions. This was very important at the time and it
                                still influences software quality discussions today. It provided a starting point for
                                further work but it does lacks the complexity and comprehensiveness of modern quality
                                models.</p>
                            <p>Another difference between the two works is the approach to evaluation. McCall <em>et
                                    al.</em> rely on a relatively simple method, with limited consideration for user
                                perspectives. In contrast, Miguel <em>et al.</em> go into a wider range of quality
                                models that incorporate user feedback, community involvement, and communication aspects
                                into the evaluation process. This reflects a shift towards more user-centric approaches
                                to software quality assessment in modern times.</p>

                            <p>Each Python linters has a different role in maintaining code quality. Pylint is the most
                                comprehensive and uncovers a wider range of issues compared to the others, which makes
                                it useful for effective for code issue detection. Pydocstyle is useful for any concerns
                                regarding the documentation. Pyflakes offers quick error detection and Pycodestyle makes
                                sure the code adheres to PEP 8 guidelines, promoting consistency in code formatting.
                                They are each effective in their individual functions, but I think Pylint is the most
                                useful overall.</p>

                            <h4>My Reflection</h4>
                            <p>Completing this assignment was one of the more difficult ones I have done during my MSc
                                and it has given me important insights into project management and decision-making.
                                Throughout the assignment, I come acrss various challenges that forced me to develop
                                analytical and strategic thinking skills. One of the primary lessons learned was the
                                importance of balancing stakeholder requirements, budget limitations, and project
                                timelines. It was easy to decide to develop a unified system or separate systems for
                                Synful and EDC but the exact costings and timeline required careful consideration of
                                efficiency and cost-effectiveness and I kept going back and forth.</p>
                            <p>The process of cost analysis and budgeting was quite challenging. Balancing the need to
                                meet EDC's specifications while staying within the allocated budget required meticulous
                                planning and attention to detail. However, overcoming this challenge provided valuable
                                insights into financial management and resource allocation. </p>
                            <p>In hindsight, there are things I could have done to improve my project. Whilst putting
                                together my work for my e-portfolio I noticed I missed the prompt to put my citations
                                into my presentation. I haven’t received my final mark, but I hope this does not affect
                                me too much as I did in fact do a lot of research for this assignment. </p>
                            <p>Despite the challenges, completing the project has allowed me to develop essential skills
                                and gain knowledge that will be valuable in future projects. The experience broadened my
                                skill set and prepared me to tackle future challenges with confidence as I completed it
                                eventually and submitted work I was moderately happy with. I am still apprehensive to
                                see if I missed anything crucial. Nonetheless moving forward, I look forward to applying
                                these skills in real-world scenarios, knowing that each challenge presents an
                                opportunity for growth and learning. </p>

                            <p>I think Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) will have the most influence on
                                the field of software engineering project management in the next ten years.</p>
                            <p> AIOps, as defined by Dang <em>et al.</em> (2019), is the fusion of Artificial
                                Intelligence (AI) and Operations to enhance IT operations analytics and automation. It
                                uses machine learning and analytics to analyse vast amounts of data from various sources
                                and predict potential issues before they occur.</p>
                            <p> The study by Dang <em>et al.</em> shows the real-world challenges faced in implementing
                                AIOps, including data silos, lack of skilled personnel, and the need for robust
                                infrastructure. However, despite these challenges, the potential benefits of AIOps are
                                immense, and I believe AIOps will only become more prominent in the coming years.</p>
                            <p>Jaafari (2003) discusses the age of complexity and change in project management.
                                Traditional project management methodologies may struggle to cope with the dynamic
                                nature of software projects, leading to delays and cost overruns.</p>
                            <p> Looking ahead, AIOps is positioned to become the most influential trend in software
                                engineering project management over the next decade. As AI technologies continue to
                                advance, AIOps capabilities will expand. This will enable project managers to navigate
                                the existing complexities of software projects more effectively and efficiently, moving
                                from traditional systems AIOps (Shen <em>et al.</em>, 2020)(</p>
                            <p>AIOps offers several advantages in software engineering project management. Predictive
                                Maintenance: AIOps can predict potential issues in the software development lifecycle,
                                allowing project managers to proactively address them before they escalate. Resource
                                Optimisation: By analysing historical data and patterns, AIOps can optimise resource
                                allocation, ensuring that the right resources are allocated to the right tasks at the
                                right time. Real-Time Insights: AIOps provides real-time insights into project
                                performance, allowing project managers to make data-driven decisions and adapt quickly
                                to changes (Notaro <em>et al.</em>, 2021) .</p>
