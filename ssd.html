                            <h3>Collaborative Discussion 1: UML flowchart Initial Post</h3>
                            <h4>Open source tools are available to create UML diagrams, some are listed below. This list
                                is not exhaustive. The benefit of using such tools is that they ensure that the
                                recognised UML components are used to represent the parts of the model correctly.
                                <li>Visual Paradigm</li>
                                <li>equence Diagram</li>
                                <li>Umbrello</li>
                                Choose an open-source UML tool from the list above. Select one of the coding weaknesses
                                which have been identified by OWASP and create a flowchart of the steps which may have
                                led to the weakness occurring. Which UML models might you use to present the design of
                                your proposed software, and why are they the most appropriate choice(s)?
                            </h4>
                            <br />
                            <p>The OWASP coding weakness I will focus on is Cryptographic Failures (OWASP, 2021).
                                Cryptographic Failures have been chosen by the OWASP as the second most significant
                                security vulnerability due to their prevalence within web applications and the
                                significant negative impact they can have. Cryptographic failures are when mistakes or
                                weaknesses are made in how data is protected using encryption which means the data is
                                easier for third parties to access. Examples of how this could happen is if sensitive
                                data is sent in clear text over a vulnerable network or there is mismanagement of
                                encryption keys and hackers are able to access them and use them to decode encrypted
                                data (Sharma, 2023).</p>
                            <p>I believe an activity diagram would be a suitable choice because it focuses on the flow
                                of activities, and provides a high-level overview of how tasks, decisions, and actions
                                are interconnected. This means the activity diagram would effectively showcase the
                                actions that could lead to a Cryptographic Failure and would clearly show the decision
                                points that lead to a failure, as Cryptographic failures often involve decisions made by
                                the developers, such as choosing an encryption algorithm or key generation method.
                                Activity diagrams can also show parallel or concurrent activities, highlighting
                                situations where multiple actions are happening simultaneously. This is important as
                                there are multiple ways a Cryptographic Failure could occur and so an activity diagram
                                allows this to be illustrated. </p>

                            <h4>Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security.</h4>
                            <h4>Select five terms from ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 Terms and Definitions and write
                                a 300-word blog post on how people can be managed to overcome cyber security attacks
                                from the inside.
                            </h4>
                            <p>Cybersecurity is a complex challenge, and one key aspect is handling the human element to
                                prevent insider threats. By understanding and applying important concepts from ISO/IEC
                                Standard 27000 Section 3 Terms and Definitions, we can effectively address cybersecurity
                                risks that come from within an organization.
                            <ol>
                                <li>3.69 Risk Management: Managing people within the context of cybersecurity means
                                    taking
                                    a systematic approach to understand and deal with risks. This involves identifying
                                    potential vulnerabilities, assessing how likely threats from within the organisation
                                    are, and understanding their potential impact. By understanding these risks,
                                    organisations can tailor their strategies to proactively tackle these specific
                                    internal
                                    threats. </li>

                                <li>3.53 Policy: Well-defined and clear security policies are the foundation for
                                    managing
                                    insider threats. These policies should outline expected behaviors, responsibilities,
                                    and
                                    the consequences of not following them. These policies serve as guidelines for
                                    employees, creating a culture of awareness and adherence to cybersecurity practices.
                                </li>

                                <li>3.46 Monitoring: Continuous monitoring is crucial for quickly detecting and
                                    responding
                                    to insider threats. Using robust monitoring systems and technologies allows
                                    organisations to observe user activities, network traffic, and system behaviors.
                                    Identifying suspicious activities promptly minimises potential damage.</li>

                                <li>3.40 Likelihood: The likelihood of insider threats can vary based on factors like
                                    the
                                    organisation's industry, the type of data they handle, and the security measures in
                                    place. Understanding this likelihood is important for prioritising security efforts
                                    and allocating resources effectively.</li>

                                <li>3.15 Control Objective: Setting clear control objectives is essential for managing
                                    insider
                                    threats. These objectives define specific security goals and measures that need to
                                    be
                                    achieved. Control objectives can include user access controls, data encryption, and
                                    incident response plans, among other measures, to prevent and mitigate internal
                                    threats
                                    effectively.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>By incorporating these concepts into their cybersecurity strategy, organisations can
                                empower their employees to actively participate in defending against insider cyber
                                threats. Educating employees, keeping them informed, and developing a security-conscious
                                culture can make them an integral part of the solution, reducing the probability of
                                internal attacks and enhancing overall cybersecurity. Ultimately, it's the
                                collaboration between people and technology that can help organisations overcome
                                internal cybersecurity challenges.</p>

                            <h3>Collaborative Discussion 1: UML flowchart Summary Post</h3>
                            <p>I appreciate the feedback from my peers on my post on cryptographic failures. Their
                                contributions have added valuable insights to my initial post, offering different
                                perspectives.</p>

                            <p>One of my classmates emphasised the importance of using an activity diagram
                                to visualise the process and identify potential flaws. Additionally, they suggested
                                delving deeper into the advantages of this approach.</p>

                            <p>Another classmate recommended enhancing the clarity of the diagrams by distinguishing
                                between the perspectives of a hacker and a legitimate user. This approach would
                                allow a better understanding of the processes the activity diagram showed. They also
                                suggested
                                exploring alternative UML diagrams, such as use case diagrams, to systematically
                                identify potential vulnerabilities, which I think is a very valid point.</p>

                            <p>Another issue brought up was the aspect of effective encryption key
                                management and other encryption-related issues which I hadn't considered.</p>

                            <p>Cryptographic failures, as outlined in my initial post are an important issue. They
                                represent vulnerabilities in
                                the systems' encryption mechanisms, posing a substantial risk to sensitive data.
                                Understanding these vulnerabilities is important for enhanced security.</p>

                            <p>Activity diagrams are adept at representing the flow
                                of actions, choices, and interactions within a system. They help in visualising the
                                process, decisions, and activities that can lead to vulnerabilities. Furthermore, they
                                can effectively depict parallel actions, which is critical as cryptographic weaknesses
                                can occur along several pathways. This approach is in alignment with recommendations by
                                Farooq (2022), who emphasises that activity diagrams can graphically illustrate the
                                weaknesses and mistakes in the process by focusing on the decisions and activities that
                                result in cryptographic failures.</p>

                            <p>When looking into cryptographic failures, we should also consider the impact and
                                consequences. Ali (2023) has detailed potential implications of cryptographic failures,
                                including data breaches, a decline in trust, legal and compliance issues, and
                                intellectual property theft. These consequences show the urgency of addressing
                                cryptographic vulnerabilities and implementing effective preventive measures.

                            <ol>
                                <li>What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</li>
                                <br />
                                <p>Cifuentes & Bierman (2019) propose that a secure programming language should provide
                                    first-class language support to address common, significant vulnerabilities found in
                                    real-world software. They suggest that secure languages should address
                                    vulnerabilities such as buffer errors, injection errors, and information leak errors
                                    and should provide "first-class language support" to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
                                    These three vulnerabilities have been identified through analysis of the National
                                    Vulnerability Database (NVD). The presence of safe abstractions, mechanisms for
                                    preventing vulnerabilities, and proper handling of memory and data manipulation are
                                    key factors that determine whether a programming language is secure.</p>

                                <p>Factors that determine whether a programming language is secure include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Support for secure coding practices: A secure language should provide features
                                        and
                                        constructs that make it easier for developers to write secure code.</li>

                                    <li>Handling of common security vulnerabilities: It should address the causes of
                                        common
                                        and significant vulnerabilities found in real-world software, such as buffer
                                        overflows, injection errors, and information leaks.</li>

                                    <li>Memory management: The language's memory management mechanisms should prevent
                                        vulnerabilities like buffer overflows.</li>

                                    <li>Type safety: Type safety mechanisms can help prevent certain types of
                                        vulnerabilities.</li>

                                    <li>Security libraries: Availability of security libraries and tools for encryption,
                                        authentication, and access control.</li>

                                    <li>Community support: A strong community that actively addresses security issues
                                        and
                                        provides security patches.</li>

                                    <p>Mainstream programming languages, including Python, are considered inherently
                                        insecure because they do not fully address all these factors. </p>
                                </ul>
                                <li>Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</li>
                                <br />
                                <p>Cifuentes & Bierman (2019) argue that no mainstream programming language, including
                                    the ones commonly used today (such as Java, C, C++, Python, PHP, JavaScript, and
                                    Ruby) address all three categories of vulnerabilities: buffer errors, injection
                                    errors, and information leak errors. While Python is acknowledged to address certain
                                    vulnerabilities like buffer errors through managed memory, and some aspects of
                                    injection errors through taint tracking, it does not provide safe abstractions for
                                    preventing all the identified vulnerabilities. </p>

                                <p> Given this analysis, it could be argued that Python, like other mainstream
                                    languages, may not be fully classified as a secure language according to the
                                    authors' definition, which requires addressing all three categories of
                                    vulnerabilities. However, Python's focus on readability, ease of use, and its
                                    ongoing community efforts to improve security can contribute to writing secure code
                                    within the language. </p>

                                <p> Therefore, Python is not classed as a completely secure language. While Python has
                                    features and libraries that can be used to write secure code, it also has
                                    limitations and areas where it may not fully address security concerns. Python has
                                    been analysed for security vulnerabilities and found to have issues, particularly in
                                    areas like input validation, overflow errors, and web application security. </p>

                                <p> However, Python's security can be improved through careful coding practices, using
                                    secure libraries, and staying informed about security best practices. Python's
                                    community actively addresses security issues and provides updates, which is a
                                    positive aspect. </p>

                                <p> In summary, Python can be used to write secure code, but it depends on how it is
                                    used and whether developers follow secure coding practices. It may not be classed as
                                    a fully secure language, but it can be a secure choice when used correctly. </p>
                                <li>Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.
                                </li><br />
                                <p>Python is not typically considered a suitable language for creating operating
                                    systems. Operating systems require low-level control over hardware and memory, which
                                    Python lacks due to its high-level nature. C, on the other hand, is commonly used
                                    for operating system development because it provides the necessary low-level
                                    features and control. </p>

                                <p> While Python is known for its simplicity and ease of use, these features are not
                                    well-suited for building the complex, performance-critical components of an
                                    operating system. C, with its close-to-hardware capabilities, is better suited for
                                    this purpose. </p>

                                <p> In summary, Python is not a better language than C for creating operating systems.
                                    Each language has its own strengths and is suited for different purposes, and the
                                    choice of language depends on the specific requirements of the project. </p>
