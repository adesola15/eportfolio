                            <h3><u>My Reflection</u></h3>
                            <p>Writing my literature review on the financial impact of ransomware and malware in the
                                healthcare sector was an enlightening experience. The assignment allowed me to delve
                                deep into the nature of these cyber threats, their direct and indirect financial
                                consequences, and the necessary cybersecurity measures. I set myself the learning
                                outcomes of understanding the economic challenges posed by cyber-attacks in healthcare,
                                analysing case studies, and exploring mitigation strategies. I believe I have
                                successfully described the topic and covered these key aspects comprehensively.</p>

                            <p> At the beginning of writing, the complexity of the topic was somewhat overwhelming, but
                                I found that starting with general research made it a bit more manageable. The more I
                                read about the effects of cyber-attacks on healthcare providers, the more I began to
                                understand the landscape of the topic I had chosen. As I continued researching the task
                                became less overwhelming and it was helped by the plan, I completed in Unit 4.</p>

                            <p>The research process was intense, and I had to come up with an organisation system as
                                this piece of work contained many more references than I am usually used to. At times,
                                the volume of references was challenging to manage, especially as I kept rewriting
                                sections, which caused moments of frustration. However, these challenges pushed me to
                                develop better time management and organisational skills and ensured that I stayed on
                                track and maintained the quality of my work.</p>

                            <p>I have gained a deeper understanding of the intersection between cybersecurity and
                                healthcare. One significant realisation was the importance of proactive cybersecurity
                                measures and the critical role of regulatory compliance. This new perspective has
                                changed my approach to both my studies and my view on cybersecurity in general. Having
                                previously studied healthcare subjects, this topic was of particular interest to me as I
                                was able combine my interest in healthcare with my interest in computer science.</p>

                            <p>A key learning point was the identification and analysis of indirect costs associated
                                with cyber-attacks. Before this project, I was primarily aware of direct costs like
                                ransom payments. However, understanding the broader financial implications, such as
                                downtime, data recovery, and long-term reputational damage, has broadened my analytical
                                skills and deepened my appreciation for comprehensive cybersecurity strategies.</p>

                            <p>Throughout this literature review, I have maintained academic integrity by accurately
                                citing and referencing all sources. I knew this to be important to ensure the
                                credibility of my work and I always pay attention when citing my references. The
                                adherence to proper citation standards has also enhanced my attention to detail and
                                academic rigor. I did get feedback that I needed to work on critical analysis as I was
                                just describing concepts in each paragraph with one citation to end, and I will
                                definitely take this into consideration going forward into my Research Project Proposal.
                            </p>
                            <p>In conclusion, this assignment fostered my academic growth by allowing me to complete a
                                deep dive on a topic. It has increased my understanding of the financial impact of
                                cyber-attacks on healthcare and explained to me the importance of robust cybersecurity
                                measures, which I will take forward into my second assignment for the module.</p>

                            <h3><u>My Reflection</u></h3>
                            <p>Completing my research proposal presentation, "A Cost-Benefit Analysis of Ransom Payment
                                vs. Recovery Investments in Healthcare Ransomware Attacks," has been a stressful but
                                overall satisfying experience that has deepened my understanding of both the topic and
                                research processes. This reflection captures my journey, the challenges faced, and the
                                lessons learned.</p>
                            <p>Going into the research proposal presentation was less daunting than the literature
                                review because I already had a background on the topic. In fact, it was delving into the
                                existing literature that revealed a significant gap in comprehensive analyses comparing
                                ransom payments to recovery investments specifically within healthcare which led me to
                                choosing this topic. I was able to understand the importance of my research topic and it
                                motivated me to contribute meaningful insights to this area of discussion.</p>
                            <p>Even though I had a background on the topic I must admit that I did become a bit stressed
                                when completing the parts of the research proposal presentation I had never done before.
                                Although I had done the research for my literature review, I had to continue searching
                                existing literature. Kruse et al.'s (2017) findings on the vulnerability of healthcare
                                systems due to outdated IT infrastructure, alongside Everett's (2016) discussion on the
                                unpredictability of data recovery after ransom payments, were particularly important and
                                they hadn’t been a part of my literature review.</p>
                            <p>The learning outcomes of this module significantly influenced my approach. The papers
                                provided a strong foundation, and I made sure to implement the feedback from my
                                literature review and critically analyse the sources to build a coherent argument was
                                challenging. This meant I was able to get a distinction on my research proposal
                                presentation whereas I’d only been able to achieve a merit for my literature review. I
                                was very happy with this.</p>
                            <p>One of the most valuable skills developed during this process was the ability to conduct
                                a thorough research proposal presentation from start to finish. This involved not only
                                summarising existing research but also critically evaluating methodologies, identifying
                                gaps, and proposing directions for future research. These skills are directly applicable
                                to real-world scenarios, such as designing effective cybersecurity policies or
                                conducting risk assessments in healthcare organisations.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, writing and presenting this research proposal presentation was a
                                challenging yet rewarding experience. It honed my research skills, deepened my
                                understanding of a critical issue, and provided valuable insights.</p>

                            <h4>My Reflection on the Object-Oriented Programming Module</h4>
                            <p>What?</p>
                            <p>Looking back at the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) module, I found the workload a lot
                                higher than previous modules. With my background not being in computer science, I was
                                initially very concerned about designing and implementing a program from scratch.
                                Despite these concerns, I successfully completed my final assignment gaining a deep
                                understanding of OOP principles.</p>
                            <p>So What?</p>
                            <p>The most important part of this module was the practical application of OOP concepts.
                                Developing the driverless car program required breaking down complex problems into
                                manageable parts, which enhanced my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. That
                                experience differed from previous learning because it was highly practical and hands-on,
                                pushing me to apply theoretical knowledge in a real-world context. Also, my skills in
                                Python improved a lot, as working with Python on real-world scenarios made me more
                                comfortable with its syntax and features.</p>
                            <p>What Next?</p>
                            <p>From this experience, I learnt the importance of applying theoretical knowledge through
                                hands-on practice to master complex concepts. In my projects since I haved used the OOP
                                principles I gained to complete other pieces of work. Additionally, I adopted the focused 
                                approach I used during this module to manage tasks effectively. The OOP module was
                                a very significant module in my MSc journey.</p>
